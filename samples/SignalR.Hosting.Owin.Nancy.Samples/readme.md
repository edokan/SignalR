# SignalR and Owin and Nancy Demo

A demo of SignalR served over Owin with Nancy in the background living it up.

## Running:

If you like to push the green arrow to make it go in Visual Studio try setting it up like this:

1. Start `ghost` as the external program to use in debugging.
2. Pass any command line arguments you want
3. Set the working directory to the `SignalR.Hosting.Owin.Nancy.Samples` directory (that's this one!)

Press the green arrow button for happy times! *Or* just run [ghost] from this sample directory.
